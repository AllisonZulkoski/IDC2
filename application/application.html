        The product connects to the bit and uses wires to travel up the length of the reins and around to the box that contains my Arduino circuit. The vibration motor connects from the circuit and can be connected to either somewhere on your body in a place of your choosing or directly to your hands through the long wires.

        The product works well considering how cheap all of the materials are, including the load cell. The first thing I would improve is the quality of it and its design. The load cell works really well for what its designed for (the luggage scale) but it was extremely difficult to figure out how to attach it to my bridle. The current setup required that the wires don't snap or get torn from the load cell (which is the most likely way this would break). I originally wanted the load cell to be pulled on directly from the reins, that just wasn't possible with the materials I have or the shape of the load cell. I also originally wanted to copy what I have on the other side; doing so would both fix the problem of the uneven length distribution and give me feedback from both sides as opposed to just one. I want to find some way to hide the wires. I don't like the fact that there are a lot of exposed wires, I just didn't want to waste a bunch of heat shrink tubing. I did figure out I could sew leggings together to make the cover I have from the bit to my hands along the length of the reins, but there wasn't an easy solution for the smaller wires. With that, my horses and I are extremely rough on our tack, so we need something that will hold up against pressure, dirt, being dragged, etc. Because of the way I put everything together, the project isn't easily removable and I will have to take my bridle home to dissassemble it. Ideally if this is a project I would produce for sale, I would find some way to make a bluetooth connection from the load cell to an app for more reliable data and less wires. I do really like how useful and applicable this project is. I absolutely could turn this into a professional career of making wearable technology for equestrians. I am super happy with how this turned out, especially considering the timeframe I had to work with, and I think this could be a really cool concept to apply to future projects.
